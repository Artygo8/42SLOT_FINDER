# Find slots

*The first version of this code was not from me, it was from https://github.com/artainmo/find_slots, but finally I changed it all.*

**Right now the script is using selenium.**

### Usage

  Set environment

  ```
  make env
  ```

  Launch

  ```
  make
  ```

### Explained

While the program is working, it is displaying dots, just so you know its active. Once a slot is found, a *!* will appear and you will hear a sound.
